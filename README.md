# LOCALIZATION IN VUE
We have implemented a localization strategy that involves utilizing the [vue-i18n package](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) for seamless language switching, [crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) for high-quality translation services, and [crowdin ota-client](https://crowdin.github.io/ota-client-js/) for direct integration with the translations available on crowdin. And also using the translation directly from the crowdin instead of downloading it locally.
